      Lakshadweep (/ləkˈʃɑːdwiːp/, About this sound Lakṣadvīp (help·info), Lakshadīb), formerly known as the Laccadive, Minicoy,
      and Aminidivi Islands (/ˌlækədaɪv ˌmɪnɪkɔɪ ... ˌæmɪnˈdiːvi/),[2] is a group of islands in the Laccadive Sea, 200 to
      440 km (120 to 270 mi) off the south western coast of India. The archipelago is a Union Territory and is governed by
      the Union Government of India. They were also known as Laccadive Islands, although geographically this is only the
      name of the central subgroup of the group. Lakshadweep comes from Lakshadwipa, which means "one hundred thousand islands"
      in Sanskrit.[3][4] The islands form the smallest Union Territory of India: their total surface area is just 32 km2
      (12 sq mi). The lagoon area covers about 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), the territorial waters area 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq
      mi) and the exclusive economic zone area 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi). The region forms a single Indian district with
